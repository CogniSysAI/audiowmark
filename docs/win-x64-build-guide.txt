In this step-by-step guide I show how to build Audiowmark
to run it on Windows x64.

I won't explain every single tool, just the creation process.
That's enough work.

Following these instructions exactly should lead to success.

Prerequisites (programs / source codes / libraries):

- Download source code from Audiowmark
  DL: https://github.com/swesterfeld/audiowmark/releases
  I chose this one : audiowmark-0.6.2.tar.zst

- Download source code from zita-resampler
  DL: https://github.com/digital-stage/zita-resampler/

- Download 7zip ( newest beta version to extract .zst files )
  DL: https://www.7-zip.org/

- Download Notepad++
  DL: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

- Download Cygwin
  DL: https://cygwin.com/

- Download CMAKE
  DL: https://cmake.org/download/

- Download MinGW-w64
  DL: https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases
  I chose this one : x86_64-13.2.0-release-posix-seh-msvcrt-rt_v11-rev0.7z

- Download FFmpeg
  DL: https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
    I chose this one : ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared.zip



Prepare everything:

- Install Cygwin ( do a clean install )
  We need to add the following libraries to Cygwin ( choose always the latest stable release )
  - gcc-core
  - gcc-debuginfo
  - gcc-g++
  - mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core
  - mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++
  - make
  - make-debuginfo
  - libfftw3-devel
  - libsndfile-devel
  - libgcrypt-devel
  - libmpg123-devel

  - libzita-resampler ( Not included in Cygwin. We have to compile and copy it later manually )
  - FFmpeg ( It is available in Cygwin, but i had some problems with it. So we add it later manually )

- Install CMAKE

- Install Notepad++

- Install 7zip ( newest beta version to extract .zst files )

- Extract zita-resempler-main.zip to c:\zita-resempler-main

- Extract audiowmark-0.6.2.zip to c:\audiowmark-0.6.2

  Edit "c:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\utils.cc" and insert the following line directly below the comment section ( needed for vasprintf )
  #define _GNU_SOURCE

- Extract ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared.zip to c:\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared

- Extract x86_64-13.2.0-release-posix-seh-msvcrt-rt_v11-rev0.7z\mingw64 to c:\mingw64

- Add "C:\mingw64\bin" to the system path variable and place it at the top most position

- Important : Restart Windows !

- After restart windows edit the file c:\zita-resempler-main\CMakeLists.txt with Notepad++.
   Find the line below # make ( should be line 22 ) and insert the parameter SHARED.
   # make
      before:
      	add_library(zita-resampler ${SOURCES} ${HEADER_LIST})
      after:
        add_library(zita-resampler SHARED ${SOURCES} ${HEADER_LIST})

- Start CMAKE
   Select the source dir c:\zita-resempler-main
   Select / create the build dir ( f.e.: c:\zita-resampler-main\build64 )
   Press "Configure"
   Choose "MinGW Makefiles as generator"
   Choose "Use default native compilers"
   Press "Finish" to complete the configuration
   We should see : Configuring done ( ignore the red values in the list above )
   After successfull configuration press "Generate"
   We should see : Gernerating done
   Close CMAKE

- Open the command prompt ( cmd.exe ) and go to the directory "c:\zita-resampler-main\build64".
   Type in:
     mingw32-make

  We should see : [100%] Built target zita-resampler

  Now we should have the following two new files:
   "c:\zita-resampler-main\build64\libzita-resampler.dll"
   "c:\zita-resampler-main\build64\libzita-resampler.dll.a"

  Close CMD

- Install zita-resampler
  - Copy the file "c:\zita-resampler-main\build64\libzita-resampler.dll" to "C:\cygwin64\usr\x86_64-pc-cygwin\bin"
  - Copy the file "c:\zita-resampler-main\build64\libzita-resampler.dll.a" to "C:\cygwin64\usr\x86_64-pc-cygwin\lib"
  - Copy the whole directory "C:\zita-resampler-main\source\zita-resampler" to "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\zita-resampler"

- Install FFmpeg
  - Copy ALL files from "C:\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\bin\*.*" to "C:\cygwin64\usr\x86_64-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\bin"
  - Copy ALL files ( except dir "pkgconfig" ) from "C:\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\lib\*.*" to "C:\cygwin64\usr\x86_64-w64-mingw32\sys-root\mingw\lib"
  - Copy ALL .pc-files from "C:\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\lib\pkgconfig\*.pc" to "C:\cygwin64\lib\pkgconfig"
  - Copy ALL sub directories from "C:\ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared\include\*" to "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\*"


Now we should be ready to build the audiowmark source code:

- Start Cygwin64-Terminal with admin rights
  Change the current directory to: /cygdrive/c/audiowmark-0.6.2

- Type in:
   ./configure --host=x86_64-pc-cygwin

- Type in:
   make.exe

All created EXE-files will be saved to "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\.libs"
Note : There is another, significantly smaller version of each EXE file in "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\". Don't use these. They don't work.


The last part to do is to build the videowmark.exe.
The file "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\videowmark" is a linux bash script and can not executed on windows.
So I ported it to C++.
To keep it simple, I made only this single CPP file without a header file.
- Copy the file "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\docs\videowmark-win.cc" to "C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\videowmark.cc"
- Open Cygwin and and go to the directory "/cygdrive/c/audiowmark-0.6.2/src/"
- Type in :
     g++ -o videowmark.exe videowmark.cc

Okay, we are almost finished.

In order to deliver audiowmark.exe and videowmark.exe all corresponding DLL- and EXE-files must also be delivered.
And that's a lot.

Every single DLL- and EXE-file we will find somewhere in "C:\cygwin64"
Each file must be copied into the SAME directory where the EXE file is located.

Location: C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\.libs\
audiowmark.exe

C:\audiowmark-0.6.2\src\
videowmark.exe

Location: /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/

libquadmath-0.dll
libssp-0.dll
libstdc++-6.dll

postproc-57.dll
swresample-4.dll
swscale-7.dll


Location: /usr/bin/

cygvorbis-0.dll
cygvorbisenc-2.dll
cygogg-0.dll

cygwin1.dll
cyggcc_s-seh-1.dll
cygfftw3f-3.dll

Location: /usr/x86_64-pc-cygwin/bin/
libzita-resampler.dll


That's it. We're done.
That was easy, wasn't it?
