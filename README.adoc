= audiowmark - Audio Watermarking

== Description

`audiowmark` is an Open Source solution for audio watermarking. A sound file
(typically wav) is read by the software, and a 128-bit message is stored in a
watermark in the output sound file. For human listeners, the files typically
sound the same.

However, the 128-bit message can be retrieved from the output sound file. Our
tests show, that even if the file is converted to mp3 or ogg (with bitrates
higher than 128 kbit/s), the watermark usually can be retrieved without
problems. The process of retrieving the message does not need the original
audio file (blind decoding).

Internally, audiowmark is using the patchwork algorithm to hide the data in the
spectrum of the audio file. Some pseoudo-randomly selected amplitudes of the
frequency bands of a 1024-value FFTs are increased or decreased slightly, which
can be detected later. The algorithm used here is inspired by

== Adding/Retrieving a Watermark

To add a watermark to the soundfile in.wav with a 128-bit message (which is
specified as hex-string):

  audiowmark add in.wav out.wav 0123456789abcdef0011223344556677

To get the 128-bit message from the watermarked file, use:

  audiowmark get out.wav

== Watermark Key

Since the software is Open Source, a watermarking key should be used to ensure
that the message bits cannot be retrieved by somebody else (which would also
allow removing the watermark without loss of quality). The watermark key
controls all pseudo-random parameters of the algorithm. This means that
it determines which frequency bands are increased or decreased to store a
0 bit or a 1 bit. Without the key, it is impossible to decode the message
bits from the audio file alone.

Our watermarking key is a 128-bit AES key. A key can be generated using

  audiowmark gen-key test.key

and can be used for the add/get commands as follows:

  audiowmark add --key test.key in.wav out.wav 0123456789abcdef0011223344556677
  audiowmark get --key test.key out.wav

== Building fftw

audiowmark needs the single prevision variant of fftw3.

If you are building fftw3 from source, use the `--enable-float`
configure parameter to build it, e.g.::

	cd ${FFTW3_SOURCE}
	./configure --enable-float --enable-sse && \
	make && \
	sudo make install

or, when building from git

	cd ${FFTW3_GIT}
	./bootstrap.sh --enable-shared --enable-sse --enable-float && \
	make && \
	sudo make install

== Docker Build

You should be able to execute audiowmark via Docker.
Example that outputs the usage message:

  docker build -t audiowmark .
  docker run -v <local-data-directory>:/data -it audiowmark -h
