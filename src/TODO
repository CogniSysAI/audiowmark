speed detection:
 - fft planner should only run once per size
 - double decode
 - propagate debug flag from "cmp" to speed detect
 - rename methods => add_search_jobs()...
 - cleanup resampler api
 - maybe truncate cleanup
 - SpeedSync should take struct arg
 - remove pad start scaling
 - move get speed clip to speed_scan
 - average speed if more than one best-quality 50s estimate is produced
 - test code
 - document in README
 - analyze remaining variants

possible improvements:
- dynamic bit strength
